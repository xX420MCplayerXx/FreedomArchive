# FreedomArchive
BetaArchive but fully free!

# Why did I make this?
I made this as retaliartion against BetaArchive's authoritarian nature. Archives should be free to anyone, not just a select few people who have contributed in the past. If you've contributed to BetaArchive's 116+ Terabytes of archives, consider submitting it here too!
If BetaArchive changes their ways, maybe to something similar to winworldpc, I would consider them a true archive. It is a shame that so much data is locked behind a wall that requires that you have this software. Freedom for all.
